The clustering program runs 8 different clustering methods on a chosen dataset.
There are four commented at the start of main a user can choose from.
The result of clustering KMeans, Mean shift and Affinity Propagation seemed to be good candidates for
finding a maximum value. The maximum value found using each clustering is printed to the console.

When running use the -v flag to show the graphical visualizations omit the flag to not show visualizations.

Currently we are using sklearns code for DBSCAN visualization. We could not get a simple visualization of our own to work. We do not claim to have written the DBSCAN visualization code.
