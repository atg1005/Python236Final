The clustering program runs 8 different clustering methods on a chosen dataset. There are four commented at the start of main a user can choose from. The result of each clustering is then graphically displayed. 

Currently we are using sklearns code for DBSCAN visualization. We could not get a simple visualization of our own to work. We do not claim to have written the DBSCAN visualization code.
